PROJECT IMAGES GUIDE FOR OSHITHA KALHARA'S PORTFOLIO
========================================================

REQUIRED PROJECT IMAGES:

1. oricado-erp.jpg
   - ERP system dashboard or interface for Oricado & Riyon
   - Suggested dimensions: 800x600px or 1200x800px
   - Should show business management interface, tables, or dashboard

2. powerkey-erp.jpg
   - Modern React-based ERP interface for PowerKey solar accessories
   - Suggested dimensions: 800x600px or 1200x800px
   - Should show clean, modern UI with solar/energy theme colors

3. meeting-scheduler.jpg
   - Mobile app interface or mockup for the meeting scheduler
   - Suggested dimensions: 600x800px (mobile portrait) or 800x600px
   - Should show calendar, meeting interface, or mobile app screens

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETUP:
=======================

1. Create these three image files with the exact names listed above
2. Place them in the 'public' folder of your project
3. Update the image references in the Projects component:
   - Change `image: 'oricado-erp.jpg'` to the actual image path
   - Change `image: 'powerkey-erp.jpg'` to the actual image path  
   - Change `image: 'meeting-scheduler.jpg'` to the actual image path

4. If you want to use the images, update the Projects.tsx file:
   - Replace the gradient placeholder divs with:
     <img src={project.image} alt={project.title} className="w-full h-48 object-cover" />

ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS:
===================

If you don't have project images available:
- Keep the current gradient placeholders with project initials
- Use stock photos from Unsplash/Pexels related to:
  - Business dashboards for ERP projects
  - Mobile app interfaces for the mobile project
- Create simple mockups using design tools like Figma or Canva

EXTERNAL LINKS:
==============

Remember to update the project links in Projects.tsx:
- Replace '#' with actual project URLs, GitHub repositories, or live demos
- If projects are private/confidential, consider creating demo videos or case studies

The current design works well with or without actual project images, using beautiful gradient placeholders as fallbacks.
